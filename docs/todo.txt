    1. One or more remotes are added
    2. Get keys from all remotes





    1. Keys are loaded from local into memory...
    
    2. Keys are loaded from remote if there is login info saved.
    3. If any keys have older timestamp or different timestamp && is_dirty, ask how to resolve
    4. If resolve is "download" or no conflicts were found, find all keys with newer timestamps on remote and download them in one request.
        a. downloaded results are written to memory and to local.
    5. If conflict was found and resolve was "upload", find all keys with conflicts and upload them.

    6. 

    6. User get: await current request (new requests can always chain onto the current request promise).
    7. Access data on user object
    8. Call get(). Parses saved string to new obj.
    9. Set with set(obj). Dirty is marked and saved to pref as well.
    
    10. Save individual data or from jormun, all dirty objects and mark them as not dirty.
