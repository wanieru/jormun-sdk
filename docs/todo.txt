List of concerns:
    -apps will not function when running out of localstorage space.
        -Electron versions and native app versions will solve it
        -Raise alert when pref saving fails.
    



    1. Keys are loaded from prefs...
    
    2. Keys are loaded from sync server if there is login info.
    3. If any keys have older timestamp or different timestamp && is_dirty, ask how to resolve
    4. If resolve is "download" or no conflicts were found, find all keys with newer timestamps and download them in one request.
        a. downloaded results are written to Data and to respective Pref.
    5. If conflict was found and resolve was "upload", find all keys with conflicts and upload them.

    6. User get: await current request (new requests can always chain onto the current request promise).
    7. Access data on user object
    8. Call get<any>()
    9. //How to change object so it is marked as dirty? Similar system to react? Also, how to best hook up a data point to a react class state? Saved in pref includes dirty.
    
    10. Save individual data or from jormun, all dirty objects and mark them as not dirty.
